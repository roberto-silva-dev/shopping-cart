## üåê Testing the API

The project includes a Postman collection to simplify API testing.

### With Postman
- Locate the [`docs/postman_collection.json`](docs/postman_collection.json) and [`docs/postman_environment.json`](docs/postman_environment.json) file in the repository.
- Import it into Postman by following [this guide](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-postman-data).

### With other clients
- If you desire to test the API using other client, you must set up:
- - **Base URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- - **X-CSRFToken**: `<csrf_token>` - the token will be set on cookies when you call the `/auth/csrf` endpoint - Just for http methods that aren't GET
