#### This project is deployed at [https://shopping-cart.portfolio.robertosilva.dev](https://shopping-cart.portfolio.robertosilva.dev)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git
- Postman (optional, to test the API)

---

## üöÄ How to set up the project

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/roberto-silva-dev/shopping-cart.git
cd shopping-cart
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure the database and static files
The project uses SQLite3 by default. No external database setup is required. Just run the migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### 5. Create initial users and products
Run the script to create the default users and products:
```bash
python manage.py runscript setup
```

#### Default user credentials:
- **Administrator**
  - **Username:** `admin`
  - **Password:** `admin`
- **Common user**
  - **Username:** `common`
  - **Password:** `Common@2024*`
- **VIP user**
  - **Username:** `vip`
  - **Password:** `Vip@2024*`

### 6. Run the local server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

## üåê Testing the API

The project includes a Postman collection to simplify API testing.

### With Postman
- Locate the [`docs/postman_collection.json`](docs/postman_collection.json) and [`docs/postman_environment.json`](docs/postman_environment.json) file in the repository.
- Import it into Postman by following [this guide](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-postman-data).

### With other clients
- If you desire to test the API using other client, you must set up:
- - **Base URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- - **X-CSRFToken**: `<csrf_token>` - the token will be set on cookies when you call the `/auth/csrf` endpoint - Just for http methods that aren't GET
---

## üìö API Endpoints
You'll have access to all the configured API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint           | Description                              |
|--------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/cart`            | List all items on cart besides the total |
| POST   | `/cart/items`      | Add or upgrade an item to cart           |
| GET    | `/cart/items/<id>` | Get details from a specific item at cart |
| PATCH  | `/cart/items/<id>` | Update the item at cart                  |
| DELETE | `/cart/items/<id>` | Remove a specific item from cart         |
| GET    | `/auth/csrf`       | Set the CSRF token on cookies            |
| POST   | `/auth/login`      | Perform login                            |
| GET    | `/auth/profile`    | Get the profile's data                   |
| POST   | `/auth/logout`     | Perform logout                           |

More details about each endpoints are available in the [`/docs/swagger`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/swagger) or [`/docs/redoc`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/redoc) endpoints.



# Architecture and design summary

## Framework
- **Backend Framework:** Django with Django REST Framework (DRF) for handling RESTful public endpoints.

## User roles & cart handling
- **Common user:** Default for non-logged users or logged users without VIP status.
- **VIP user:** Logged users with VIP status, identified by `user_type` field in the user model.
- **Anonymous users:** Can add items to the cart, just like logged-in users, but their cart is temporary and not linked to any account.
- **Logged-in users:** Have a persistent cart tied to their account.

### Cart merging on login
When an anonymous user logs in, their cart (from the session) is merged with their existing account cart, if any. This ensures a seamless experience where no items are lost upon login.

## Promotions
- **Common users:** The "Get 3 Pay 2" promotion is available.
- **VIP users:** "Get 3 Pay 2" promotion or a 15% discount is available, but not both. The system picks the best option for the user based on the higher discount.

## Access control
- All endpoints are public. Role-based logic (VIP vs. Common) is applied based on authentication and user status.

## Key design decisions
1. **Scalability:** 
- DRF‚Äôs modular architecture allows for easy extension of the system to support additional user roles or new features.
- The apps are separated based on resource types and responsibilities, making it easier to manage and scale the system as the project grows.
2. **User experience:**
 - The role-based categorization ensures an intuitive user flow, with seamless transitions between "Common" and "VIP" functionalities depending on login status.
3. **Security:**
- The system uses CSRF tokens to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks and CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests.
4. **Maintainability:**
- The use of DRF viewsets and serializers promotes code reuse and simplifies maintenance as the system grows.
5. **Documentation:**
- The functions and classes are well-documented, making it easy to understand and maintain the codebase.
- The API documentation is generated using the [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) and [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) tools. Usefully for testing and development.

## Summary
This architecture provides a flexible, extensible structure that supports both anonymous and logged-in users while ensuring that cart merging and promotions are handled seamlessly. The design maintains simplicity and scalability as the system grows.
